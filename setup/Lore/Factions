== Chapter one : The Twenty Factions in One World ==
Yep, you read well, unlike what we could think first seeing 4 colors + 1 neutral, there are no 5 factions, but 20. Each colors are referencing to the environnement they are living in (mountain, forest, lakes and water, desert or prairies), and nothing else. They are even not allied because they are from the same color. For example, Shaytans and Solars, two yellow factions, are mortal ennemies.

But let's see each faction quickly :

<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">1. The Mîrnast Empire :</span> The human empire of Mîrnast is the first worldpower. Gigantic and strong, the Empire still has a lot of troubles right now. They are at war with multiple ennemies, and the rebellion against the scientific revolution (which came with faëria mastery) is eating it from inside.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">2. The Kingdom of Meroval :</span> it was the first human kingdom, Meroval is the symbol of the old human's exploit. Old allied of the Empire, it is often considered as a part of it. They still refused the scientific revolution and are well attached to the old traditions and beliefs.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">3. The Kingdom of Thyria :</span> way younger is the human kingdom of Thyria. Established in the ruins of the Old Thyria and founded by the giants themselves, the kingdom of Thyria is one of the richest in the world. The Thyrians founded their own religion based on a unique God, and their Church is very powerful since they have their own armies and have their hands in the economy.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">4. The rebellion :</span> The rebellion is a group of strewn rebels who decided to fight against the Emperor and his scientifical revolution and politics. They want to keep their right to use their old customs and life by their ideals of strengh and power instead of trusting blindly in the giant machines the scientifics are building. They are not well armed or trained, and it's sometimes hard to say if someone is a rebel fighting for their beliefs or a common bandit looking to make profit.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #3399FF;">5. The City of Gabria :</span> Gabria was, with Thyria, the first power of the world before Orobouros woke up. After the Snake got jailed, the majority of Gabria were submerged. In front of the new threats of the world, the few gabrians survivors hidded under the sea for thousands of years. Recently, the small mochis came to Gabria and offered to the old gabrians their help to rebuild the city, if gabrians let them occupuy the emerge part of the town.<br>
<span style="color: #3399FF;">6. The Tritonis Kingdom :</span> Tritonis is the capital of the triton's land. There are a lot of tritons over the world, but the wonderful Puken'pin where Tritonis reside is the only place where they truly govern themselves. It's a peaceful place, a true refuge in this world in war.<br>
<span style="color: #3399FF;">7. Kappas communities :</span> Kappas are not really forming a full faction, but more several communities who lives peacefully in lost regions of the world. Living with barely no technology, they still are very clever, and the oldest turtles count among the most wise creatures in the world. Kappas are considered as a faction as they are still civilized (in their own way).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FFFF00;">8. The Amaï Empire :</span> The Amaï Empire is the richest country in the world. Amaïs are from a very long time the best sailors and traders living, fonding branch all over the world. Living for profit, they trade everything without conscience as long as it can make them richer. Strangely, they have no army, but they are so rich that, if someone wanted to attack them, they could hire whole kingdoms as mercenaries if they wanted to, so nobody really wants to fight them.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFF00;">9. The Oradrimms :</span> leaded by the Djidan order of Templars, the oradrimms have been a very powerful faction, once. But they got beaten down a long time ago by kobolds and forced to go back to their natal Island. Now, pushed by their ideal of balance, and because they think using faëria, the divine energy, is going to destroy the world, they want to force other races to stop using it. It's still a project, but the Djidan order is really preparing his comeback.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFF00;">10. The Republic of Solaris :</span> Solaris is the only republic in the world, and probably one of the most impressive place on earth. Solars have an impressive advance in term of technology and nobody can fight them in their lands. Indeed, using a gigantic system of mirrors, they managed to bring an endless light in their lands, so the night never fall again. Knowing their natural relation with the light, everybody can understand why they are unbeaten in their desert.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFF00;">11. The Shaytans :</span> Shaytans were solars, before. But when they understood the light was going to stop reaching their lands, and that their only chance to survive was an unrealizable project of mirrors proposed by a crazy engineer, they decided to turn themselves to the origin of light, Orobouros. They begged him to give them another source of light, and he did. He gave them a heart of fire, who saved them, but also turned them into perverted mutant creatures.<br>
<span style="color: #FFFF00;">12. The Keldrans tribes :</span> Keldrans are not a full faction either, but some tribes of desert warriors and travellers. They are probably the best for flying on the back of any creature, and learn to mount before walking. Nomadic (by flying), living close or even inside the Amaï empire, they are often hired as mercenaries by them to protect caravans or even ships.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #33CC00;">13. The Tiki tribes :</span> The tikis tribes are united since they joined the Green Alliance and saved the Gaea Tree during the Second Kobold War. Tikis are nomadic small creatures, but their cute faces shouldn't trick you, they are the best while it's about using poison, and their embushes and traps are famous all over the world.<br>
<span style="color: #33CC00;">14. The Sagamis tribes :</span> Member of the Green Alliance from it's creation, Sagamis have been the Gaea Tree protectors from a very long time. Each sagami tribe is independant, but they are all united when anyone make one step into their forests. Indeed, sagamis are quite agressives with any creature who don't come from the sacred forest, and their voodoo rituals are quite scary.<br>
<span style="color: #33CC00;">15. The Eldritzs :</span> Eldritzs are small and peaceful creatures living in a very small area of the sacred forest. They joined the Green Alliance but they are always reticent to fight, except of course if someone try to invade the forest. Even if they seem so cute and peaceful, Eldritzs can be fast as lightning and an unexpected threat to anyone who's not attentive.<br>
<span style="color: #33CC00;">16. The Dryads :</span> "dryad" is a generic term to refer to several forest spirits living all over the world. Dryads are the first defensors of the sacred forest, they often lives alone, and attack anything stranger, which makes the sacred forest a very dangerous place to cross. Dryads are all fighting together in the Green Alliance when the Alliance decide to go in war.<br>
<span style="color: #33CC00;">17. The Old Thyrians :</span> The old Thyrians are the old Giants, sons of the gods, who created the world with them. Their knowledge has no equal, and their wisdom aswell. But the giants are only few, and their old country is now a Human Kingdom. Just awake from a thousand years sleep, they try to recover a part of their lands without fighting. That said, nobody knows if it's by wisdom or because they simply wait all of them are awake before exterminate the small humans.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #CC0000;">18. The Kobold Empire :</span> The Dragon Empire is the last memory of what was well called "the kobold era" . Right after the destruction of the world, kobolds took the control of the whole world. 3 giant empires were ruling it, trying to beat the lasts still resisting : the Green Alliance. After several endless wars, they finally got beaten, and some impressively bloody civic wars ended to destroy the empires. Bur recently, the emperor Khrazek bringed new slaves into the empire, and with them, a stability nobody would trust. With Trows as slaves, they are now back in game, and if nobody pay attention, the Kobold era may come back sooner then expected.<br>
<span style="color: #CC0000;">19. The Goblins :</span> Goblins are small and incredibly clever creatures, really obessed about the mastery of Faëria and the art of explosion. Took as slave by the Kobold Empire of Tavaryn, their revolution were the final strike to the old empire, ravaged by the civic war. Since then, they took back all the kobold territory and now try to expand their kingdom even further, by fighting dryads and Gabrians tritons.<br>
<span style="color: #CC0000;">20. Trows :</span> Well, poor Trows, it's barely if we can really say it's still a faction. Trows were small creatures living in peace in a small country next to the Sacred Forest, inventing wonderful machines and digging into the old kobolds tunnels. But now, they are nothing else than kobold's slaves, and the only few free trows remaining have nothing else to do than pray for a miracle...<br>
<br>
Remember everything here is still able to change, and if you wonder why a faction you know is not referrenced here (like trolls, or shedims), it's simply because they are not civilized or lives alone, and so are not considerate as a faction.

== Chapter two : the political relationships ==
As I already told you, it's not because two factions are from the same color that they are friends. It would be very long and boring to enumerate every political relationship in the world of Faëria, so a short table is probably way better than a long text. Sadly, right now we can't post tables directly on the forum (it will come later as I understood), but I can give you a downloadable one. So here we go :<br><br>
